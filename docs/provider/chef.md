## Chef

`Chef External Secrets provider` will enable users to seamlessly integrate their Chef-based secret management with Kubernetes through the existing External Secrets framework.

In many enterprises, legacy applications and infrastructure are still tightly integrated with Chef/Chef Infra Server/Chef Server Cluster for configuration and secrets management. Teams often rely on Chef data bags to securely store sensitive information such as application secrets and infrastructure configurations. These data bags serve as a centralized repository for managing and distributing sensitive data across the Chef ecosystem.
